<br>
### The Problem
<br>
- Indian roads are bumpy

- **Intended** : Speed Breakers

  - Poorly painted/marked speed-breakers cause accidents : Speed breakers in India kill more people than accident do in UK, Australia

 - **Unintended** : Potholes

   - Potholes damage and slow down vehicles. Accidents too.

   - Road Accidents are common but response is delayed. Depends upon eye-witnesses or victims.

   - Accident prevention & alert measures exist for modern cars using sensors. Can’t be applied to existing vehicles without significant costs.

<br>

### The Solution
<br>
We present an Android app that uses the MapMyIndia API, a phone’s accelerometer and gyroscope reading and a Machine Learning model to:

- Non-intrusively detect road accidents and alert emergency response services automatically.

- Intelligently track and display road conditions by identifying roads with potholes and suboptimal conditions.

- Alert drivers about upcoming speed breaker based on historic data gathered from other drivers

- Suggest routes based not just on traffic and distance, but also on road quality.

- Create a call to action by alerting municipalities to fix potholes.

- Provide a framework for individual contractors to bid on re-construction tasks based on crowd-sourced pothole data.

<br>

### Who needs this
<br>
- Ola/Uber - Route suggestions

- Municipalities - Pothole tracking

- Individual Contractors - Contracts to fix roads

- Drivers (Janta) - Route suggestions, Speed breaker and Pothole warnings
